Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ where a human player can play against the computer. The game features two types of computer opponents: a random player, which makes random moves, and a smart player, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The game can be played in a terminal or command line interface.

Features
Human vs Computer: A human player can play against a computer player.
Random Computer Player: A computer player that selects random moves.
Smart Computer Player: A computer player that uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.
Game Status Display: The game board is updated and displayed after each move.
Win/Tie Detection: Automatically detects wins, losses, or ties.
Game Rules
The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are simple:

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in empty squares.
The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
